## What's this blocklist about?

Well, just bumped into an artictle about how to overcome Windows 10 sending telemetry data.

## Why do you think it's a good thing and worth trying?

Why not? ;-)

Microsoft and others try to use my data without giving anything back. I am responsible for what happens with my IT systems, so I need to be in full control. As Microsoft does not give me some handy buttons to tune telemetry settings (and does not let me complety disable it), let's fight back.
